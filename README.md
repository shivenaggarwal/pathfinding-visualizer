# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer!

I created this programme because I was facinated by pathfinding algorithms and wanted to see how they worked. I'm hoping you have as much fun experimenting with this visualisation tool as I did making it.

This React project uses the Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the separation between two spots on the screen that have obstructions in their path.
